#The first structurally randomly generated L-system will be the 
#"progressive_rules" for the represented L-system. It will take some kind of
#noise and then shape that noise into a structure (using it's own, randomly 
#generated rules, the "seed_rules") which will be translated into the
#"progressive_rules".
#I am effectively trying to create an L-system whose rules are being
#progressively being generated.
